Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository. If you are an employer looking at these files, please contact me with any questions and concerns via the contact information on my Resume. 

The files listed are all free to download and I welcome suggestions for my site formatting and project design. 

Here you can see any document that I use on my [GitHub page](https://griffinsalyer.github.io), and you can find those files specifically in the code folder. Generally, any project name folder I have will just include and index.md file that links to the html files for that project. 

Thank you lots!
