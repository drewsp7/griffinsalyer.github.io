## Welcome to Griffin's Portfolio! 
-----

This site is meant to showcase some of my completed projects. Additionally, the idea of this site is to not only show the work I have done, but to also present my progression over time, and the evolution of the completeness of the projects as I learn more in the field. Please bear with me, the projects posted here may be complete - but usually serve as learning opportunities for me to construct my skills in analytics. Keep this in mind, and send me feedback if you think something could be improved! Thank you!
