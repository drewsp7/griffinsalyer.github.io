This case project represents a report-style optimization presentation. The goal was to optimize the shipping carrier selection such that it minimizes costs. The constraints included minimum fees, and contracts with certain shipping companies. This project was one of the first projects I presented in this style, and showcases some of my earliest work in Python Jupyter Notebooks.
